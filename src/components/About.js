        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
          As a Registered Dietitian since 2014, I've enjoyed working with others
          and helping improve others' health through lifestyle changes and
          nutrition education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I am looking for a change to constantly learn and grow and found
          Software Engineering as my new passion. Time passes by so quickly with
          building projects, creating applications, and using new technologies.
          I would like to continue helping others with my newfound passion in
          technology.
