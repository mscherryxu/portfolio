        <p>
          As a Registered Dietitian since 2014, I've enjoyed working with others
          and helping improve others' health through lifestyle changes and
          nutrition education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I am looking for work opportunities to keep learning and growing
          as a Software Engineer. Time passes by so quickly with building
          projects, creating applications, and using new technologies. I would
          like to continue helping others with my newfound passion in
          technology.
